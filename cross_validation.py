'''Cross validation'''

# how will it work here? This is not supervised learning

# Number of iterations will be fixed (or run till convergence)
# Number of clusters is what we must cross-validate over
#   For each number of clusters:
#       Repeat for i iterations:
#           Run clustering algorithm


# TODO: write code to not stop clustering till error decrease is less than some threshold, or after a certain number of iterations, whichever comes first
